An UI/UX project for a mental health website that i made from scratch without using any tutorials.

- It has several components like an A.I chatbot, mood tracker, a well-being community chat group.
- I have also made a questionnaire that will help in suggesting the most suitable therapist to the user.
- The user can get 24x7 access to mental health professionals.
- This site also provides one on one therapy session through video calling by using zoom.


Here are the images of my design:
